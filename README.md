David, in case you see this before the email, here's what I wrote you.

Dear David

You don't know me, but I've been following your work for quite some time and I'm a big fan of Quartz Things. I'm a journalist from Switzerland who likes to work with code and data. Recently, I've been working on a thing that I think could be a good fit for Quartz.

It's an analysis of countries' sex ratios from 1961 to 2013, worldwide. It starts with the surprising fact that there are more men than women on this planet and goes on to show how vodka, migration, wars and infanticide shape sex ratios in countries all over the world.

I've added you to the Github repo so you can have a look (zip attached, if you prefer that): https://github.com/davidbauer/sexmap

It's not finished yet, but you'll get the idea, and if you're interested, we can discuss what to include in the final piece (currently, it's built as a standalone piece, as I developed it in a hack week with the primary goal to get better at D3).

Let me know what you think.

Best,
David
