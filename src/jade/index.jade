Less than one quarter of all people who lived in Qatar in 2013 were women. The main driver behind this development is that those countries have attracted a lot of migrant workers for male-dominated industries, especially after oil prices started rising in the 1970s. Millions of men, mostly from South Asia, came to work on the Arabian Peninsula, but weren&apos;t allowed to bring their spouses and children with them, thus

              p
                | There is, however, another striking development to be observed with the former Soviet states. Their populations had moved towards more gender balance, up until the point when the Soviet Union dissolved, when the trend reversed. The extraordinarily high percentages of 1961 were still an effect of World War II, when the Soviet Union lost close to 15% of its population, many of them young men. As time passed, this effect diminished, bringing down the gender imbalance, albeit still at world-record level.
              p

                | What most of these countries have in common – and what is certainly true for the average of all of them – is that over the past decades there is a trend towards a more balanced population. One of the main drivers behind this trend is that the gap between men's and women's life expencancy has narrowed, due to occupations and lifestyles becoming more similar. While the difference for «more developed regions» was 7.8 years between 1985-1990, it

              p
                | We've seen that highly developed countries are quite homogenous in terms of gender ratios. In contrast, the four big emerging economies of the BRIC states strikingly fall into three groups. China and India, as seen before, are strongly imbalanced towards men, Russia even more strongly imbalanced towards women, with Brazil firmly in between. In Brazil, a widening gap in life expectancy has made the population shift from almost perfectly balanced towards female. In 1960, women were expected to live four years longer than men, today this difference is seven years.

In fact, a majority of countries in Africa has both genders within 49.5% and 50.5% of the total population. At first glance, they resemble the likes of Sweden and Norway, but the balance results from different circumstances.

                a(href='http://esa.un.org/wpp/Documentation/pdf/WPP2012_Volume-I_Comprehensive-Tables.pdf', target='_blank') life-expectancy at birth is 2.4 years
