              p
                | Of course, the number for the whole world levels out regional differences. Female population ranges from 23 to 55 percent, some countries have seen a change of 19 percentage points over the past 5 decades, others have had notable ups or downs in relatively short periods.

                | . What makes this possible, even though a majority of countries has more men than women, is the fact that the most populous countries in the world are also highly imblanced: China has nearly 50 million more men than women, India 42 million. At a distant third is Pakistan, which has a surplus of around 5 million men. Pakistan used to be even more imbalanced than China and India, but has been catching up over the past decades.
              p

The availability of affordable prenatal diagnostic techniques has only accentuated the trend, which means the gender gap in the general population is bound to widen in the coming years, as more balanced older generations pass away. In an attempt to break the trend, India has legally banned sex determination before birth in 1994

Less than one quarter of all people who lived in Qatar in 2013 were women. The main driver behind this development is that those countries have attracted a lot of guest workers for male-dominated industries, especially after oil prices started rising in the 1970s. Millions of men, mostly from South Asia, came to work on the Arabian Peninsula, but weren&apos;t allowed to bring their spouses and children with them, thus throwing gender ratios off balance

              p
                | There is, however, another striking development to be observed with the former Soviet states. Their populations had moved towards more gender balance, up until the point when the Soviet Union dissolved, when the trend reversed again. The extraordinarily high percentages of 1961 are still an effect of World War II, when the Soviet Union lost close to 15% of its population, many of them young men. As time passed, this effect diminished, bringing down the gender imbalance.

              p
                | It has to be noted at this point that the data, provided by the World Bank, based on the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects, uses interpolation between five-year periods to obtain annual data. Events that caused a significant change within a relatively short time might thus be reflected in the data with a delay and appear more linear than they have in fact been.
              p
                | As you can see in the following chart, both the Iraq-Iran war in the 1980s and the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 left those countries with a significantly more female population than before.
