			<h2>A closer look</h2>
			<p>Let's now take a closer look at specific countries and groups of countries that share some characteristic. We will see the various reasons for gender imbalance manifest themselves in the data and how differently countries' gender ratios have developed over time.

		<section class="la">
		<p>Left to nature alone, the population on earth would be give or take 50 percent men and 50 percent women. The fact that women generally live longer (XX vs YY years in 2013) is compensated by more boys than girls being born (107 boys per 100 girls in 2013). In 1961, the earliest year the World Bank provides data for, the world was within 0.09 percent of a equal distribution. Ever since, the gap has widened, now men outnumber women on the planet by almost 60 million.

		<p>Of course, the number for the whole world levels out regional differences. Female population ranges from 23 to 55 percent, some countries have seen a change of 19 percentage points over the past 5 decades, other have had notable ups and downs in relatively short periods.</p>

		<p>It has to be noted that the data, provided by the World Bank, based on the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects, uses interpolation between five-year periods to obtain annual data. Events that caused a significant change in a relatively short time, mostly wars and genocides, might thus not be reflected in the data with a delay and appear more linear than they have in fact been.</p>

			<h3>The missing girls in China and India</h3>
			<p>In 2013, men outnumbered women on the planet by roughly 58 million. What makes this possible, even though a majority of countries has more men than women, is the fact that the most populous countries in the world are also highly imblanced China has nearly 50 million more men than women, India 42 million. At a distant third is Pakistan, which has a surplus of around 5 million men. Pakistan used to be even more imbalanced than China and India, but has been catching up over the past decades.</p>

			<p>Gender imbalance starts at birth in these countries. Both China and India have birth sex ratios that are well off the worldwide average. In 2013, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2018.html">China had 1.11 boys born per girl, India 1.12, as compared to 1.07 worldwide</a>. Both countries are infamous for widespread gender selective abortions and female infanticide. WHAT CHANGED IN PAKISTAN (birth sex ratio now below world average, 1.05 in 2014?</p>

			<h3>Guest workers on the Arabian Peninsula</h3>
			<p>The most gender imbalanced states in 2013 are all found on the Arabian Peninsula, Qatar being the most extreme. Less than 1/4 of all people who lived in Qatar in 2013 were women. The main driver behind this development is that those countries have attracted a lot of guest workers, especially after oil prices started rising in the 1970s. Millions of men, mostly from South Asia, came to work on the Arabian Peninsula, but weren't allowed to bring their women or children with them, thus throwing gender ratios off balance.</p>

			<h3>Heavy drinking in Russia</h3>
			<p>The former Soviet states are notorious for their men's short life expectancy, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/31/russian-men-losing-years-to-vodka">largely attributed to alcohol-related deaths</a>. <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.61360?lang=en">According to the WHO</a>, women in Russia live – on average – 12 years longer than men, a larger difference than anywhere else in the world. The only countries that come close are other former states of the Soviet Union. It is this difference in life expectancy that makes the population in those states particularly «female».</p>

			<p>There is, however, another striking development to be observed with the former Soviet states. Their populations moved towards more gender balance, up until the point when the Soviet Union dissolved, when the trend reversed again. (EXPLANATION NEEDED FOR THIS)</p>

			<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human</p>
