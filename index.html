			<h2>A closer look</h2>
			<p>Let's now take a closer look at specific countries and groups of countries that share certain characteristics. We will see the various reasons for gender imbalance manifest themselves in the data and how differently countries' gender ratios have developed over time.
		</section>
		
		<section class="la">
			<p>Left to nature alone, the population on earth would be give or take 50 percent men and 50 percent women. The fact that women generally live longer <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> is compensated by more boys than girls being born <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. In 1961, the earliest year the World Bank provides data for, the world was within 0.09 percentage points of a perfectly equal distribution. Ever since, the gap has widened, now men outnumber women on the planet by almost 60 million.

			<p>Of course, the number for the whole world levels out regional differences. Female population ranges from 23 to 55 percent, some countries have seen a change of 19 percentage points over the past 5 decades, others have had notable ups or downs in relatively short periods.</p>

			<h3>The missing girls in China and India</h3>
			<p>In 2013, men outnumbered women on the planet by roughly 58 million<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. What makes this possible, even though a majority of countries has more men than women, is the fact that the most populous countries in the world are also highly imblanced China has nearly 50 million more men than women, India 42 million. At a distant third is Pakistan, which has a surplus of around 5 million men. Pakistan used to be even more imbalanced than China and India, but has been catching up over the past decades.</p>

			<p>Gender imbalance starts at birth in these countries: Both China and India are infamous for widespread gender selective abortions and female infanticide<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup>. Both countries have birth sex ratios that are well off the worldwide average. In 2013, China had 1.11 boys born per girl, India 1.12, as compared to 1.07 worldwide<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. The availability of affordable prenatal diagnostic techniques has only accentuated the trend, which means the gender gap in the general population is bound to widen in the coming years, as more balanced older generations pass away. In an attempt to break the trend, India has legally banned sex determination before birth in 1994<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

			<p>Two other countries from the region with a similar population structure, Pakistan and Bangladesh, have seen quite siginicant changes over the past decades. <span class="todo">TODO: WHY IS THAT?</span></p>

			<h3>Guest workers on the Arabian Peninsula</h3>
			<p>The most gender imbalanced states in 2013 are all found on the Arabian Peninsula, Qatar being the most extreme. Less than 1/4 of all people who lived in Qatar in 2013 were women. The main driver behind this development is that those countries have attracted a lot of guest workers, especially after oil prices started rising in the 1970s. Millions of men, mostly from South Asia, came to work on the Arabian Peninsula, but weren't allowed to bring their women or children with them, thus throwing gender ratios off balance.</p>

			<h3>Heavy drinking in Russia</h3>
			<p>The former Soviet states are notorious for their men's short life expectancy, largely attributed to alcohol-related deaths<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. According to the WHO, women in Russia live – on average – 12 years longer than men, a larger difference than anywhere else in the world<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>. The only countries that come close are other former states of the Soviet Union. It is this difference in life expectancy that makes the population in those states particularly «female».</p>

			<p>There is, however, another striking development to be observed with the former Soviet states. Their populations had moved towards more gender balance, up until the point when the Soviet Union dissolved, when the trend reversed again.<span class="todo">TODO: emigration? confirmation or other explanation needed</span></p>
			<figure class="linechart chart-7"></figure>

		<section class="la">
			<h3>War and genocide in Rwanda, Cambodia and Iraq</h3>
			<p>Not only long-term developments become visible in the data. Disruptive events such as wars and genocides show as well. Since they tend to claim more men's lives than women's, the population's sex ratio usually shifts towards female.</p> 

			<p>It has to be noted at this point that the data, provided by the World Bank, based on the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects, uses interpolation between five-year periods to obtain annual data. Events that caused a significant change within a relatively short time might thus be reflected in the data with a delay and appear more linear than they have in fact been.</p>

			<p>As you can see in the following chart, both the Iraq-Iran war in the 1980s and the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 left those countries with a significantly more female population than before. Even more staggering is the effect of the mass killings by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1978, when around a quarter of the whole population died.</p> 
			
			<p class="todo">TODO: whats up with GUATEMALA? (why rise *after* the genocide)?</p>

			<p>The most dramatic changes can be seen in Libya, though. Female population rose from less than 47 percent in 1985 – one of the lowest in the world – to 50 percent in 2013. <span class="todo">TODO: RESEARCH REASONS, EMIGRATION?</span></p>
			<figure class="linechart chart-6"></figure>

		<section class="la">
			<h3>The homogenous top</h3>
			<p>One of the strongest predictors of a country's sex ratio is how developed it is. Highly developed countries tend to have more women in their population. 13 of the top 15 countries in the Human Development Index and 29 of 31 high-income OECD states (as defined by the World Bank) have a female population above 50%<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>.</p>
			<p>What most of these countries have in common – and what is certainly true for the average of all of them – is that over the past decades there is a trend towards a more balanced population. One of the main drivers behind this trend is that after 1990, men's life expencancy has risen more significantly than women's, narrowing the difference from 7.8 years to 6.8 years<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>.</p>
			<p>Included in the chart are the current top 3 nations from the Human Development Index, Norway, Australia and Switzerland.</p>
			<figure class="linechart chart-1"></figure>
		</section>

		<section class="la">
			<h3>The diverse BRICS states</h3>
			<p>We've seen that highly developed countries are quite homogenous in terms of gender ratios. In contrast, the five big emerging economies of the BRICS states strikingly fall into three groups. China and India, as seen before, strongly imbalanced towards men, Russia even more strongly imbalanced towards women, while Brazil and South Africa both have a balanced population, with a slight trend toward more women.</p>
			<figure class="linechart chart-2"></figure>
		</section class="la">

		<section class="la">
			<h3>Strongest trend towards women</h3>
			<p>Hong Kong, Sri Lanka and Nepal are the countries that have seen the strongest move towards a more female population over the past five decades<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>. The most striking development has taken place in Hong Kong over the past 35 years. The share of women in Hong Kong's population has skyrocketed from below 48 percent in 1980 to over 53 percent in 2013.</p>

			<p class="todo">TODO: research reasons for this development and find out if they are similar to what happeded in the other countries.</p>
			<figure class="linechart chart-4"></figure>
		</section>

		<section class="la">
			<h3>The US and its neighbors</h3>
			<p>Looking at five decades of sex ratios in North America, Mexicos development stands out. What you can clearly see in the chart is how mass emigration from Mexico to USA starting in the 1990s<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">12</a></sup> significantly changed the sex ratio in Mexico. Since more more men than women left Mexico, the ratio of females in the Mexican population rose sharply.<span class="todo">TODO: find source to back this up</span>.</p>
			<p>Mexico is exemplary for a general trend here. Since historically, significantly more men than women have migrated, migration has had an effect on sex ratios, especially in countries with a high net migration rate, either positive or  negative. As women's share in migration is rising, the effect is becoming weaker, though<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup>.</p>
			<p class="todo">TODO: explain US and Canada developments</p>
